Takes a function of no args and yields a future object that will
  invoke the function in another thread, and will cache the result and
  return it on all subsequent calls to deref/@. If the computation has
  not yet finished, calls to deref/@ will block, unless the variant
  of deref with timeout is used. See also - realized?.
